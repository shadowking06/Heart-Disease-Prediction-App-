There are various steps which will give flow to this project .

Step 1 :-

1. Heart Data

This refers to the dataset that contains information related to patients' heart health. This dataset typically includes various features (attributes) such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant medical metrics, as well as the target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

Steps :-

Acquire the Dataset : Obtain a dataset that contains medical data relevant to heart disease. For instance, the UCI Heart Disease dataset is commonly used.

Load the Dataset : Use libraries such as pandas to load the dataset into a Data Frame.

The UCI Heart Disease dataset is commonly used for this purpose.


Step 2 :-

2. Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves cleaning and transforming the raw data into a format that can be used by machine learning algorithms. This step typically includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalizing or scaling numerical features, and splitting the data into features and target variables.

Steps :-

Handle Missing Values : Check for and handle any missing data in the dataset.

Encode  Categorical  Variables : Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding.

Normalize / Scale Features : Standardize or normalize numerical features to ensure they are on a similar scale.


Step 3 :-

3. Train-Test Split

This step involves splitting the dataset into two parts: a training set used to train the model and a testing set used to evaluate the model's performance. 

Typically, a common split ratio is 80% training and 20% testing .

Step :-

Split the Data : 

Use the train_test_split  function from sklearn to split the dataset.


Step 4 :-


4. Logistic Regression Model

Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome . 
    
It is used for binary classification problems .

Steps :-

Initialize the Model : Create an instance of the Logistic Regression model.

Train the Model : Fit the model on the training data.

Evaluate the Model : Assess the model's performance on the testing data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.


Step 5 :-

5. New Data - Trained Logistic Regression Model - Prediction

Using the trained logistic regression model to make predictions on new, unseen data.
      

Steps :-

Prepare the New Data : Preprocess the new data in the same way as the training data.

Make Predictions : Use the trained model to predict the target variable for the new data.


Note :-

ECG Plays An Important Role !
Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is a medical test that measures the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time. This test is essential in diagnosing various heart conditions by detecting irregularities in the heart's rhythm and structure.
