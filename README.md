# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction App

Welcome to the **Heart Disease Prediction App**! This project uses **Python** and **Machine Learning** to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on user input. The app utilizes a **Logistic Regression** model for predictions.

## 🌟 Features

- **User Input Form:** Enter patient details to get predictions.
- **Heart Disease Prediction:** Based on logistic regression model.
- **Model Training:** The model is trained on a dataset of patient records.
